# Path finding

The code requires the external library BOOST (https://www.boost.org/). After you installed BOOST and downloaded the source code, go into the directory of the source code and compile it with CMake: 
```
cmake .
make
```

Then, you are able to run the sample code:
```
./lifelong -m maps/kiva-10-500-5.map -k 10 --scenario=KIVA --simulation_window=15 --planning_window=15 --solver=PBS --seed=0 --task=maps/10-small-1.txt --simulation_time=1600 -t 120
```

- m: the map file 
- k: the number of agents
- scenario: the simulation scenario (each scenario corresponding to a different task assigner). Use KIVA for the fulfillment warehouse scenario and SORTING for the sorting center scenario. 
- simulation_window: the replanning period h
- planning_window: the planning window w
- solver: the windowed MAPF solver (WHCA, ECBS, and PBS)
- seed: the random seed
- task: the input task assignment file generated by LNS
- simulation_time: time limit


You can find more details and explanations for all parameters with:
```
./lifelong --help
```
